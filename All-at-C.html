<h2>C introduction</h2>
<p>C was developed by Dennis Ritchie in Bell Labs, USA, around 1972</p>
<p>It is a procedural low level programming language (developed from BCPL)</p>
<p>The language set is small (around 30 key words) and it relies heavily on functions in the standard C library
to perform tasks. It has a low level of abstraction and partly due due to these properties it has some safety and security issues
(ie it does not check array bounds and has no garbage collection mechanism). It is highly portable (used on many computing 
platforms eg Linux, Windows, Mac and others) and fast and efficient and opinions differ as to how strongly or weekly typed a 
language it is. It has been used in many operating systems and in embedded systems/devices.It is a compiled language and there 
are many available C compilers.</p>
<p>C has given rise to newer languages (especially C++ and VisualC and others eg Java, Python etc).</p>
<p>This document is based on my own notes about basic C programming.</p>
