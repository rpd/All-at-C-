<h1>All-at-C</h1>  
<h2>C introduction</h2>
<p>C was developed by Dennis Ritchie in Bell Labs, USA, around 1972</p>
<p>The original implementations of C were defined as described in the classic reference, THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, 
by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. This definition left a few things to be desired, and the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI) formed a group in the 1980s to tighten up the spec. The result was "ANSI C". 
After this there have been several updates, eg C89 and C11, notably the latest.</p>
<p>It is a procedural low level programming language (developed from BCPL)</p>
<p>The language set is small (around 30 key words) and it relies heavily on functions in the standard C library
to perform tasks. It has a low level of abstraction and partly due to these properties it has some safety and security issues
(ie it does not check array bounds and has no garbage collection mechanism). It is highly portable (used on many computing 
platforms eg Linux, Windows, Mac and others) and fast and efficient and opinions differ as to how strongly or weakly typed a 
language it is (as such I presently think of it as inbetween strong and weakly typed!). 
It has been used in many operating systems (Linux especially) and in embedded systems/devices. 
It has been used to create many software programs, from wordprocessors to chess engines 
(in fact, I have an interest in basic chess programming and there are several basic C chess programs which use "open source" code
and prove useful to help learn how to use C practically).</p>

<p>C is a compiled language and there are many available C compilers.In brief, .c and .h C sourcefiles, are processed by the 
C compiler, firstly with the preprocessor, which adds any necessary library files and then the C compiler creates 
an object file .o and these are then linked by a linking process into the binary(exe) program file. 
This is the file that can be run to produce the program output! The compiler can be called and run from the command window 
or terminal or from within a suitable C IDE (IDE=Integrated Development Environment eg MS VisualStudio, Geany etc etc)</p>
<p>The binary (exe) file the C sourcfiles produce from the C compiler acting on the C sourcefiles, comprise of binary data the 
computer processor understands and uses to produce output to screen or audio or other.
The binary data is in the form of bits and bytes. So, all data entered into C sourcefiles, ultimately gets converted into bits 
and bytes by the compiler.</p>
<p>It is not object orientated.</p>
<p>C has given rise to newer languages (especially C++ and MSVisualC++ and others eg Java, Python etc). Most newer languages,
have built and extended on the C syntax and added more features to help make writing and making programs easier. If though,
you learn to understand how programming works in C, then you should be able to more easily learn any newer language, 
as you will already understand many programming concepts.</p>
<p>This document is based on my own notes about basic C programming.</p>
<h4>Learning C</h4>
<p>There are many websites and tutorials and books to learn C from. There are about 10-15 major basic topics that need to be learnt 
(eg Variables, Constants, Datatypes, Statements, Functions, Pointers, Branching and flow, Memory and a few more). 
The first example program is a "Hello world" to start and then continue with more and more advanced C programs. It is essential to 
write your own C sourcefiles and programs to be sure you can apply your new C programming knowledge!</p>

<h2>C language (syntax)</h2>
<p>The natural language of C is known, as its syntax (grammar). It provides a convenient way to describe the properties of bits 
and bytes, so C code can be built into a useful program that will run properly when used by the computer processor.</p>

<p>The main C programming features will now be described (ie data types, variables, constants, expressions, statements, 
functions etc etc)</p>
<h3>DATA TYPES</h3>
<p>C has only a few inbuilt datatypes eg Integer, Character, Float, Double and Void. All data entered in a program, should have a 
known datatype, so the processor knows how to handle the data in memory. In C, the exact properties of these datatypes may 
also depend on the C compiler and on the computer processor. For example a "character" (char) datatype is exactly one byte of 
memory (whatever the C compiler or computer processor), while an "integer" (int) can be 2-4 bytes 
(depending on the compiler and processor).</p>

<p> An integer datatype is an int. It represents an integer or whole number. If we were using a traffic control program, a bus 
variable might be created to represent a bus and it could be given the type integer (int) which represents what value the bus 
variable can have.
If we were doing a math program to calculate the area of a circle, we may want the datatype of the diameter of the circle to 
be a float or double, as they represent real numbers (with different floating point precision).</p>
