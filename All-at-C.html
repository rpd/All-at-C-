<h1>All-at-C</h1>  
<h2>C introduction</h2>
<p>C was developed by Dennis Ritchie in Bell Labs, USA, around 1972</p>
<p>It is a procedural low level programming language (developed from BCPL)</p>
<p>The language set is small (around 30 key words) and it relies heavily on functions in the standard C library
to perform tasks. It has a low level of abstraction and partly due to these properties it has some safety and security issues
(ie it does not check array bounds and has no garbage collection mechanism). It is highly portable (used on many computing 
platforms eg Linux, Windows, Mac and others) and fast and efficient and opinions differ as to how strongly or weakly typed a 
language it is (as such I presently think of it as inbetween strong and weakly typed!). 
It has been used in many operating systems (Linux especially) and in embedded systems/devices. 
It has been used to create many software programs, from wordprocessors to chess engines 
(in fact, I have an interest in basic chess programming and there are several basic C chess programs which use "open source" code
and prove useful to help learn how to use C practically).</p>

<p>C is a compiled language and there are many available C compilers. It is not object orientated.</p>
<p>C has given rise to newer languages (especially C++ and MSVisualC++ and others eg Java, Python etc).</p>
<p>This document is based on my own notes about basic C programming.</p>
