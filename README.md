My beginner C programming notes

This is a repo of my basic C programming notes.
Over many years of personal computing and internet use, I have learnt something of programming in various languages and I enjoy
web developing, designing and creating. I dabbled with any language that served my purpose (eg Perl, Java, JavaScript, Python etc) and this includes the C language. I find myself returning to C more regularly than any other language, and wanted to apply myself to learn C well some while back, but I have never had enough time to do so.

Anyway, I have decided to add my C programming notes to this GitHub repo to serve as a reminder of the basics of C and this will only be suitable for those new to C programming and I cannot even guarantee how useful this repo will be! I shall be building it up over time. ENJOY! :-)
